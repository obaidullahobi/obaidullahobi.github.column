                The exhibition is arranged by archaeological site and features new maps and media specially commissioned
                by the National Geographic Society. The display begins with objects from Tepe Fullol in northern Afghanistan.
                In 1966, farmers discovered the first evidence of a Bronze Age civilization in the region. The nearby Oxus
                riverbed may have provided the gold used to create the artifacts found in a burial cache at the site.
                A highlight is a gold bowl fragment dating around 2000 B.C., depicting bearded bulls, an image familiar 
                in the art of Mesopotamia<a href="#">Click on Read More....</a>

                Archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert knew the safe contained a remarkable treasure of Afghanistan's history,
               but he didn't know how remarkable. No one in the room did that day in 2004."It was full of gold,"
               Hiebert recalled as he sat in the Asian Art Museum, which is exhibiting the safe's contents and
              other Afghan treasures in a major show that begins Friday. "It was unbelievable."
              The San Francisco exhibition, "Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures From the National Museum, Kabul," 
              is a tribute to a country whose culture has withstood a 30-year onslaught.By themselves, 
              these priceless objects, some of which go back more than four millennia, are worthy of viewing
